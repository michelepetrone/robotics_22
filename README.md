Technical Work for "Fondamenti di Robotica", course from Prof. Siciliano @Federico II, Napoli. This work was completed with Michele Frate in March 2024.

The work's aim is to control a SCARA robot with three rotational and one translational joint, following a trajectory decided by us in 3D, simulating the model in Matlab and Simulink.
This is done through two main phases, the Cinematic Inversion, which translates the trajectory from the operative space to the joints space, and then controlling the motors of the individual joints actually to follow this trajectory while maintaining a low enough error.
Various control strategies were applied in both phases.
